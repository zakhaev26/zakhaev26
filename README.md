My name is **Soubhik ( /ˈʃoʊ.bɪk/)**, and I'm an undergrad in the **Information Technology group at the International Institute of Information Technology, Bhubaneswar (IIIT-BH)**, batch of 2026.  

I am interested in **theoretical computer science, servers, distributed systems, cloud, system software, operating systems, databases, and scaling products**.  

In particular, I’ve worked on:  
- Distributed systems, monitoring, real-time software, web APIs, scalability  
- CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous deployment), resilience, fault tolerance  
- Distributed tracing, health checks, configuration management  
- Microservices patterns, inter-service communication (synchronous & asynchronous)  
- Microservices and cloud-native applications  

I believe that understanding the underlying principles of **distributed computing** is essential for creating efficient and robust systems.  

Currently, I work as an **ASE @ Creuto-Cloud**, and I love to spend my leisure time building and discussing ideas, projects, and taking sessions in the **Programming Society Club (PSOC)** at IIIT-BH.  

I also enjoy exploring different programming languages and paradigms, learning about new technology that helps me write clean and scalable code.  

Outside of programming, I like to **watch movies, travel, watch YouTube, and play chess & football**.
