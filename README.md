### Hello 👋

- I mostly write [TS/JS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and in my leisure time I do a little [Go](https://go.dev/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) but being a programming language enthusiast I am constantly playing around with other languages.
- These days I am learning Comp Sci fundamentals 
- Besides programming languages I am also studying algorithms, databases, distributed systems, OS and designing systems.
- 📫 How to reach me: Besides Twitter I am on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soubhikgon) feel free to DM me if you have any questions
